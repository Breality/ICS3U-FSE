# ICS3U-FSE

# Summary
Our final assessment for the course was to make a game. Instead of doing something simple, my partner Anish Aggarwal and I went beyond the scope of not just the course, but beyond the expectations of all high school courses. We created a 3D multiplayer game in Unity with online saving when expected to make a simple 2D game in Python, using the Pygame module.
Through many sleepless nights, we created a real time strategy.
