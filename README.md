# WORLD AT WAR - ICS3U-FSE

# Summary
Our final assessment for the course was to make a game. Instead of doing something simple, we went beyond the scope of not just the course, but beyond the expectations of all high school courses. We created a 3D multiplayer game in Unity with online saving when expected to make a simple 2D game in Python, using the Pygame module.
Through many sleepless nights, we created a real time strategy.

# How to Install & Play
 1. Download the server from bla bla bla and run it on a computer in your network.
 2. Download the client from https://drive.google.com/file/d/124FajWiwsLMM_C75LIOyA0Kxz2g1e7JY/view?usp=sharing and bla bla bla
 
# Controls

# What makes this impressive

# Notes
 - The computer running the server will require WiFi to access the online database
 - You only run the server on one computer. However, this is a 6 player game, so if you wish to fill up the queue, it is best to use 6 computers under the network each with the client installed. If you need a few more clients to get the game started, run more than one client on the same computer.
